# useHotkeys

:::tip You can edit all the code examples
This documentation is using [react-live](https://react-live.netlify.app/), so you can edit the code above and
immediately see the results of your changes.
:::

## Basic Usage

### Simple Hotkey

The most basic usage for the hook is to assign a hotkey you want to listen to and a callback to get executed once the user
hits that key.

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  useHotkeys('a', () => alert('Key a was pressed'))

  return (
    <span>Press the a key to see it work.</span>
  )
}
```

> The hotkeys won't work if any of the Live Editors is focused.

***

Inside the callback you can do whatever you like. One common use case is to alter some component state:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('b', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Pressed the 'b' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

`useHotkeys` will create the listener on component mount and destroy the listener once the component unmounts.

### Keystrokes

You can also listen to keystrokes, that is a combination of keys that the user has to hit in order to execute the callback.
One example would be a Jira like UI that listens to the `Shift+C` keystroke to create a new ticket:

```jsx live
function CreateIssue() {
  const [showIssueCreatorModal, setShowIssueCreatorModal] = useState(false)

  useHotkeys('shift+c', () => setShowIssueCreatorModal(true))

  return (
    <>
      {showIssueCreatorModal && <div>MODAL CONTENT</div>}
      {!showIssueCreatorModal && <div>issue list</div>}
    </>
  )
}
```

This is not restricted to a combination of two keys. You can also do things like `Ctrl+Shift+A+C` (maybe not the most
intuitive keystroke for a user to memorize, though).

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('ctrl+shift+a+c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Pressed the 'ctrl+shift+a+c' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

:::note the hotkeys arguments is case-insensitive
It doesn't matter if you listen for `CTRL+S`, `Ctrl+s`, `ctrl+S` or any other possible way of writing the keys in different
cases. They all will listen to the user pressing the `ctrl` and the `s` key. This also means that upper case letters
are treated as lower case letters. If you want to listen to the user pressing an upper case `S` letter, you'd have to listen
to `shift+s`.
:::

### Multiple hotkeys

You can also listen to multiple keystrokes and/or hotkeys and trigger the same callback. Combinations are separated by
a comma sign:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('ctrl+shift+a, c, shift+c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Received the combination {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```
