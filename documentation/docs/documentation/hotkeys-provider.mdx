# `HotkeysProvider`

The `HotkeysProvider` component is a wrapper component that allows you to group hotkeys together.
This is useful if you want to disable a group of hotkeys in a certain part of your application.

In order to use the grouping feature, you need to wrap your application with the `HotkeysProvider` component.

```jsx
import { HotkeysProvider } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';

function App() {
  return (
    <HotkeysProvider>
      <div>
        <h1>My App</h1>
      </div>
    </HotkeysProvider>
  )
}
```

Grouping works by passing setting the scope option of a hotkey.

```jsx
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';

function MyComponent() {
  useHotkeys('ctrl+a', () => console.log('ctrl+a'), { scopes: 'scopeA' })
  useHotkeys('ctrl+b', () => console.log('ctrl+b'), { scopes: 'scopeB' })
  useHotkeys('ctrl+c', () => console.log('ctrl+c'), { scopes: 'scopeA' })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

By default all hotkeys are in the `*` (wildcard) scope. This means that they will be active regardless of where you are in your application.
Wrapping your app with the `<HotkeysProvider>` component will enable the wildcard scope by default.

## Activating and deactivating scopes

You can enable and disable scopes by using the `useHotkeysContext` hook.

```jsx
import { useHotkeysContext } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';

function MyComponent() {
  const { enableScope, disableScope } = useHotkeysContext();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => enableScope('scopeA')}>Enable scope A</button>
      <button onClick={() => disableScope('scopeA')}>Disable scope A</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can also toggle scopes by using the `toggleScope` function.

:::tip Get currently active scopes
If your app is highly dynamic and you want to know which scopes are currently active, you can get an array of string via
`enabledScopes` from the context.
