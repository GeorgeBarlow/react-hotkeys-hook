# Disable Hotkeys with the `enabled` flag

We are now able to register our hotkeys, scope them to the component (or part of a component) and prevent stale state
inside our callback. But our hotkeys are always active. If the component has received focus, it will always trigger. However,
sometimes we want to dynamically decide if the hotkey should even be enabled.
